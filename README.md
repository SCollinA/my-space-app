#Space App
### Idea Origin
We love space, and one of our favorite things to do is go outside at night and look at the stars and wonder what is out there. So we designed an app to tell us what is out there and when we can see it.
Using just a user's location as coordinates, we request information from the Dark Sky API for weather and moon phases and information from the lookUP API for a space object's location.

### Demo
